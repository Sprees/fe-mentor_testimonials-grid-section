## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I focused on making utility classes for each `testimonial`. This helped with giving each individual testimonial their unique colors without an overuse of class names in my HTML. Also, the `bg-pattern-quotation.svg` had a default fill color that differed from the Figma design. I ended up editing the SVG file to change the fill color. When using the svg file as a `background-image: url()`, how can I change the fill color with CSS?

### Continued development

I will continue to strive for well-structured, maintainable CSS and proper use of semantic HTML.
